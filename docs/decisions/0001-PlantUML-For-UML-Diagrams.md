# Decision to use PlantUML for UML diagrams

## Context and Problem Statement
 In our software development project, i want to visualise and document the architecture, design and aspects of my system. I decided that i needed to find a tool that would use UML to effectively create UML diagrams. Doing this will help myself, protential stakeholders and developers visulise the system before it is created.

## Decision Drivers

* The need to visualize the software architecture
* A universal tool to use over the project to keep development simple

## Considered Options

* PlantUML
* Draw.io

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "PlantUml", because
PlantUml is an open source tool which can create diagrams using a "simple and intuitive language", can create multiple types of documents and simplifies the process of creating and editing diagrams. I would also like to note the readability as you can visually see the diagram but can also dig into the text to clearly see defined relationships.

### Consequences

* Good, because plantUML allows me to create diagrams quickly and effectively using text
* Good, because plantUML can be read it two ways.
* Good, because draw.io for me was personally very slow and kept freezing
* Bad, because although i found it quite easy to pick up, it did require time to learn the syntax
