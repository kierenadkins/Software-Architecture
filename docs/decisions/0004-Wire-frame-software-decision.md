# Decision Adobe Xd for wireframe creation

## Context and Problem Statement
In our software development proccess of planning, i am exploring software to create high-fidelity wireframmes that can serve as a visual guideline of the design and flow of the system. I want to be able to export these wireframes as photos to easily send the wireframe over to clients. while also having the ability to interconnect the wireframs to demostrate how they flow together.

## Decision Drivers

* Design clarification
* Flow clarification
* Ensuring that the application will meet usecases and persona sceniros. 


## Considered Options

* figma
* Adobe XD
* Porto.io

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Adobe XD", because
it offers a user freindly solution which is easy to use and learn while also providing us with design and prototyping needs. We can create interactive prototypes that closely mimic the final user experience. Adobe Xd also has extensive librarys that can help speed up the wireframe proccess. we are able to export all wireframes and give clear names to each. We can also show the application in practise via the play button in whcih we can mock a real application.

### Consequences

* Good, because adobe xd can handle very complex desgins
* Good, because Adobe Xd libraies can offer us consistency and time efficiency.
* Bad, as Adobe Xd is in maintenance mode which means its not actively being developed 

## Status
* Rejected

## More Information
This is no longer going to be used going forward. The intial design was developed via adobe XD
