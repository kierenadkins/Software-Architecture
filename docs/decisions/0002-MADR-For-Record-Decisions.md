# Decision to use Markdown any decision record

## Context and Problem Statement
In our software development process, i am looking for a way to document decisions. We want to find a template that we can use to do this for us. In turn we will document architecutre, software or tools and any other decisions we made during the life cycle of the project.

## Decision Drivers

* Need for documenting decisions
* To track and understand my past decisions


## Considered Options

* Markdown Any Decision Record
* Lightweight An Architectural Decision
* Microsoft Word

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Markdown Any Decision Record", because
MADR is an "lean template to capture any decisions in a structured way" and gives us a template which we can customise to our liking. Markdown also gives us highly readable documentation which can live within the git repository. With some research i can also see that MADR is widely supported in the development community  

ADR's are important as "it becomes crucial to maintain the context and rationale behind architectural decisions" and serves as a tool for "communication among team members" to gather their "thought processes, gather feedback, and foster a shared understanding of architectural decisions" (Mackay, 2023)

### Consequences

* Good, because MADR is consistent and structured
* Good, because MADR is highly readable and assessable
* Bad, because it requires inital set up

## Status
* Approved
