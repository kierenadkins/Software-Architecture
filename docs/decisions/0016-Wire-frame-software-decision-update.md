# Decision to use Markdown any decision record

## Context and Problem Statement
In our software development proccess of planning, i am exploring software to create high-fidelity wireframmes that can serve as a visual guideline of the design and flow of the system. I want to be able to export these wireframes as photos to easily send the wireframe over to clients. while also having the ability to interconnect the wireframs to demostrate how they flow together.

Previously we was using adobe-xd, however we now want to explore new options as its is not assesable without a paid subscription and has been discontinued by adobe. We now want to explore new options. We will use the new option to create our scoped wire-frame.

## Decision Drivers

* Design clarification
* Flow clarification
* Ensuring that the application will meet usecases and persona sceniros. 


## Considered Options

* figma
* Porto.io

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Figma", because
It is user-friendly and offers collaboration options. It will meet our design and prototyping needs while allowing us to create a interactive prototype. The community also offers reusable compoents that we will be able to use to quickly mock up the system. We are able to export the wireframes into either html and css which may be useful for prototyping needs.

It "Also, it combines many of the key features of other tools into a single solution to provide a more efficient and powerful workflow." (Academy, 2023)

### Consequences

* Good, because Figma offers us everything Adobe-XD did but with more features such as exporting into html.
* Good, because Figma has a large libary of already created compoentss we can use for our design.

## Status
* Approved
