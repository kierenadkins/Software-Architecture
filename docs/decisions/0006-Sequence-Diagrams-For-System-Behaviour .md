# Decision to NoSql for Data Store

## Context and Problem Statement
As part of my system design, i wanted to model and understand how diffrent components/layers within the system interact with each other. This decision will explore a few considered options for behaviour diagrams.

## Decision Drivers

* Requirement to see the flow of interactions
* need to visualize the behaviour of the system
* To help create the level 3 C4 diagram

## Considered Options

* Use Case Diagrams
* Sequence Diagrams
* Communication Diagrams


## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Sequence Diagrams", because

They are well suited for modelling the interactions between diffrent components over a time period, making them idea to cature the behaviour of the system. Alongside this they show how data is stored and retrieved

### Consequences


* Good because it shows clear visualization of system behaviour, helping other developers/stakeholders understand system behaviour better

* Good because the diagram will aid in the development of the level 3 c4 diagram

* Bad because they focus more on technical details, so may not be suited for people with less technical skills
