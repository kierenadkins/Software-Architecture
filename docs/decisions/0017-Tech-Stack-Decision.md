# {short title of solved problem and solution}

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to decide what technology we are going to use for the prototype. Eg what lanugages for the backend and frontend

## Decision Drivers

* Rapid Development
* Allignment with Non-Functional Requirements
* Experience with tech

## Considered Options

* Dot Net C# with Blazor
* Dot Net C# With React
* Python/Django with React
* Node.Js And Reach

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Dot-Net C# with Blazor", because

Dotnet is used widely in the modern world and is "simple, powerful, and type-safe" (Educative, n.d.-b), it alloes for cross platform development and is highly scalable while remaining relatively easy to learn. Id also like to note this is the tech stack the development team is most filmilar with 

"Blazor is a fast, reliable, and highly productive open-source web development framework by Microsoft"(Dissanayake, 2023), the use of blazor with dotnet also allows for the learning curve to be smaller, due to the fact that blazor uses c# code to render frontend components staight onto the browser


### Consequences

* Good, because of the rapid, scalability and alignment of experience using dotnet
* Bad, because the team will need to still learn blazor

## Status
* Dotnet C# Approved
* Blazor Pending
