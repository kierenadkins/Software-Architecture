# Decision to Use PlantUML & Draw.io for UML Diagrams

## Context and Problem Statement
In our software development project, I want to visualize and document the architecture, design, and aspects of my system. I decided that I needed to find a tool that would use UML to effectively create UML diagrams. Doing this will help myself, potential stakeholders, and developers visualize the system before it is created.

## Decision Drivers

* The need to visualize the software architecture
* A universal tool to use over the project to keep development simple

## Considered Options

* PlantUML
* Draw.io

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "PlantUML & Draw.io" because PlantUML is an open-source tool that can create diagrams using a "simple and intuitive language," can create multiple types of documents, and simplifies the process of creating and editing diagrams. I would also like to note the readability, as you can visually see the diagram but can also dig into the text to clearly see defined relationships.

I've also decided to use Draw.io as there has been time during the development where PlantUml has looked messy and has not suited the need for every diagram, one such example is the component diagam.

### Consequences

* Good because PlantUML allows me to create diagrams quickly and effectively using text
* "One of the primary advantages of using PlantUML is its simplicity and efficiency" (PlantUML, n.d.)
* Good because PlantUML can be read in two ways.
* Good because between plantUML and draw.io we can create any diagram we may need
* Bad because although I found plantUml quite easy to pick up,  it did require time to learn the syntax
* Bad because we are learning to use two diffrent software.

## Status
* Approved
